ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Patient one, 26 yrs old, had been treated with the CHOP-15 chemotherapy regimen, then salvage chemotherapy to prepare for autologous bone marrow transplant but ultimately relapsed. After initiation of crizotinib, PET, CT and bone marrow aspirates showed complete remission of previous lesions at 28 days. At time of publication the patient continued to show persistent response at 6 months. A 20 year old patient relapsed after one month of CHOP, and was treated with further chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation resulting in partial response of 1 month. Crizotinib was initialized, and after 12 days PET scan showed complete regression of all lesions. On day 60 bone marrow aspirates were ALK-negative (pretreatment evaluation showed 8% ALK-positive). The authors conclude these two cases indicate sensitivity to crizotinib of relapsed ALK-rearranged ALCL.	21345110	PubMed	NA	Gambacorti-Passerini et al., 2011, N. Engl. J. Med.

ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue.

A computational method was used to find potential gene fusions which assessed differential exon expression between the 3' and 5' ends of each gene. Two potential fusions were found and assessed using RNA ligase mediated rapid amplifiation of cDNA ends and RT-PCR. The fusions were EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2. Genomic PCR identified fusion breakpoints, and these differed from breakpoints for these EML4-ALK variants reported in NSCLC.	19737969	PubMed	NA	Lin et al., 2009, Mol. Cancer Res.

In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.
