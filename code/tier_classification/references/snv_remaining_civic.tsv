The literature also suggests that E545/E542 variants may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors (e.g., cetuximab). An FDA approved treatment regimen including a targeted PIK3CA inhibitor is available for specific subtypes of breast cancer.

This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, results are conflicting with retrospective analyses suggesting a better response to EGFR-Inhibition.

The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	PubMed	NA	Yun et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.

Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for variants in PIK3CA are still in early clinical trial phases.

997	KRAS	3845	G12C	Cancer	162	NA	ARS-853,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor	Combination	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Preclinical study to investigate mechanisms of KRAS G12C activity and inhibition with ARS-853, a covalent (irreversible) inhibitor which binds KRAS G12C in the GDP-bound state to prevent activation. Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset  (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay.  Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.	26739882	PubMed	NA	Patricelli et al., 2016, Cancer Discov	NA	3	accepted	1173	78	30	12	25398285	25398285	C	A	ENST00000256078.4	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated.

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft. Ponatinib treatment inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma cell lines.	26179511	PubMed	NA	Agelopoulos et al., 2015, Clin. Cancer Res.

R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation """"catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate"""" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).

This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS.

These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.

R173C resides in the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN. R173C was one of four mutations (out of 42 tested) that displayed no significant phosphatase activity against either substrate, indicating, by this assay, that the mutation negatively impacts the function of PTEN.   However this mutation did not affect the ability of PTEN to bind lipid membranes in-vivo.

Without treatment, H460 cells expressed high levels of phosphorylated AKT. Following treatment, p-AKT decreased which correlated with cell senescence. PI103 treatment resulted in greater cell senescence in the PIK3CA E545K cell line than in A549, a wildtype PIK3CA gefinitib-resistant NSCLC cell line.	19513541	PubMed	NA	Zou et al., 2009, Int. J.

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MDA-MB-231 is a basal-type breast cancer cell line which harbors KRAS G13D, and it had an ICD50 of 20uM. To evaluate in vivo efficacy, cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice and allowed to grow. Mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and treated with pictilisib saw no reduction in tumor volume compared to untreated control. There was no effect on G1 arrest in pictilisib treated cells; however, phosphorylated AKT (S473) was substantially reduced following pictilisib. Authors note that basal breast cancer cell lines were generally more resistant to pictilisib than luminal lines (p=0.02), and concluded that this cell line was resistant to pictilisib.	20453058	PubMed	NA	O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, results are conflicting with retrospective analyses suggesting a better response to EGFR-Inhibition. A recent prospective phase-II study (12 patients, Schirripa et. al. 2015) could not reproduce this finding and another prospective phase II trial is currently ongoing.

MDA-MB-361 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K, and it had an IC50 of 0.14uM. To asses the effect of pictilisib on cell cycle progression and apoptosis, fluorescence based cell cycle and flow cytometry were used to measure the proportion of cells in various phases and the relative presence of Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. Untreated, 68% of cells were in G1 or sub-G1. Following treatment with 1.0uM pictilisib, the proportion of cells in G1 or sub-G1 rose to 78%, and the amount of Annexin V detected rose 3 fold. A substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT (S473) was also noted. Authors concluded that pictilisib had a modest effect on cell cycle progression and encouraged apoptosis in this cell line, and that this cell line is sensitive to pictilisib.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations.

Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.

2030	RET	5979	C609Y	Thyroid Gland Medullary Carcinoma	3973	NA	NA	NA	Predisposing	Supports	B	Pathogenic	Study of a family with three generations of history indicating co-segregation of RET C609Y and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, many of whom exhibited medullary thyroid cancers specifically.  22 individuals in this family were carriers of C609Y. Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: 'PS1', 'PS3',  'PM5', 'PP1', 'PP4', and 'PP5'.	19472011	PubMed	NA	Calva et al., 2009, Ann. Surg. Oncol.

A biopsy of a resistant tumor showed an acquired G2032R mutation in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding. The same resistance mutation was observed at all the metastatic sites that were examined at autopsy, suggesting that this mutation was an early event in the clonal evolution of resistance.	23724914	PubMed	NA	Awad et al., 2013, N.

The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations.

We performed a multihistology basket study of AZD5363. 58 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of 5 lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months , 6.6 months and 4.2 months in patients with ER+ breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response. Responses were not restricted to patients with detectable AKT1 E17K in pretreatment cfDNA.	28489509	PubMed	NA	Hyman et al., 2017, J. Clin. Oncol.

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC.

Of those, 16 patients harbored KRAS G12C, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, and 9 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=15) and cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1). Median PFS was 11 weeks (6-65 weeks), median OS was 24 weeks (14-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (1-6). Median age was 62 years old (46-73), and there were 8 males and 8 females. Using these data and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739	PubMed	NA	De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.	17877814	PubMed	NA	de Gunst et al., 2007, Mol.

Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.

One patient was biopsied twice following crizotinib progression and once pre-treatment. This patient was a 27 year old female with one pack year who experienced partial response on crizotinib as 4th line therapy. The patient's pre-crizotinib biopsy was ALK+ and lacked the EGFR mutation. A biopsy taken after 63 days on crizotinib showed EGFR L858R mutation and lacked ALK gene rearrangement by FISH (ALK Loss). Of note, a second post-treatment biopsy (after 113 on crizotinib) showed ALK rearrangement but lacked EGFR mutation. The authors interpreted the emergence of an ALK negative tumor (first post-critozitinib biopsy) as evidence of a separate oncogenic driver (EGFR L858R).	22235099	PubMed	NA	Doebele et al., 2012, Clin.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

Tumor tissue for mutational status assessment was obtained from 230 patients on one or more occassions (pre-imatinib, post-imatinib/pre-sunitinib, post-sunitinib). Tissue was assessed for mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and in PDGFRA exons 12 and 18.  With sunitinib treatment, patients with a primary (pre-imatinib) KIT exon 9 mutation (n=42) displayed significantly better PFS compared with those with a primary KIT exon 11 mutation (n=143; p = .011),  significantly longer OS (p =.002), and significantly higher ORR (p=.012).

The cells were tested for Imatinib and Sunitinib resistances. GIST-T1/816 cells with 560-578 deletion and D816E mutations were resistant towards Imatinib and Sunitinib (Imatinib IC50: 604 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 3111 nM) compared to GIST-T1 cells with the 560-578 deletion mutation alone (Imatinib IC50: 30 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 15 nM). Imatinib inhibited phosphorylation in KIT and ERK at high concentrations. Sunitinib did not inhibit phosphorylation in KIT, ERK, or AKT at all. Additionally, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Sunitinib and Imatinib separately. In Imatinib incubated cells, D816E mutations were seen in less than 5% of resistant Ba/F3 cell clones only in the lowest concentration. In Imatinib incubated cells, D816E mutations were seen in approximately 10% of resistant Ba/F3 cell clones.	25239608	PubMed	NA	Garner et al., 2014, Clin. Cancer Res.

Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1.

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

Patients were treated with combination therapy or placebo for 12 months. The estimated 3-year rate of relapse-free survival was 58% in the treated group and 39% in the placebo group  with hazard ratio for relapse or death of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.58; P<0.001). 3-year overall survival rate for treated group was 86%, and 77% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.79; P=0.0006). The level of improvement observed did not cross the prespecified interim analysis boundary of P=0.000019.

This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, results are conflicting with retrospective analyses suggesting a better response to EGFR-Inhibition. A recent prospective phase-II study (12 patients, Schirripa et. al. 2015) could not reproduce this finding and another prospective phase II trial is currently ongoing.

KRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN were tested for mutation; KRAS G12V was the only variant noted in the primary rectal tumor of one patient who experienced disease progression (patient 56; Supplemental Table 1), and the primary colon tumors of two patients (9, 13; Supplemental Table 1) who experienced stable disease following treatment. In the larger cohort, patients with tumors harboring any KRAS mutation had significantly decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtKRAS tumors. Authors noted that patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations tended to have decreased PFS and OS compared to those with wild-type tumors though the differences were not statistically significant.	19223544	PubMed	NA	Sartore-Bianchi et al., 2009, Cancer Res.

This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.	26758680	PubMed	NA	Testoni et al., 2016, EMBO Mol Med	NA	5	accepted	6376	1656	4	9	133748333	133748333	C	T	ENST00000372348.2	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2018-11-05 23:10:28 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6376	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1656	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4	FALSE	R351W

Patients were enrolled into two cohorts on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status (N=341). PIK3CA mutation was determined according to the presence or absence of any hot spot mutation in the C2, helical, and kinase domains of PI3K (corresponding to exon 7, 9, and 20, respectively). In the cohort of patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer, PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR 0.65, p<0.001). In the cohort without PIK3CA-mutated cancer, the HR was 0.85.

Similarly, patient-derived GIST-T1/670 cells with 560-578 deletion/T670I mutations (Ponatinib IC50 = 8 nM, Sunitinib IC50 = 15 nM) showed no resistance towards Ponatinib and Sunitinib compared to GIST-T1 cells with 560-578 deletion (Ponatinib IC50 = 5 nM, Sunitinib IC50 = 48 nM). Additionally, del 557-558/T670I cells was implanted into mice and treated with Ponatinib or Sunitinib. Ponatinib or Sunitinib were shown to be effective in treating the Ba/F3 mutant cells as tumor volume progressively decreased to zero at around 14 days.	25239608	PubMed	NA	Garner et al., 2014, Clin.

Saos-2 cells were transfected with TP53-R273H mutation and these cells were used in the study. Using a western blot, Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells were shown to have a 0.6-fold down-regulation (compared to the Control) for Procaspase-3 protein expression. In addition, Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells were shown to be more resistant to methotrexate and doxorubicin. Reduced levels of drug-induced apoptosis were seen in Saos-2/TP53-R273H cells treated with doxorubicin (0.05 uM and 0.10 uM) and methotrexate (25 nM and 50 nM) in DNA fragmentation assays. According to the results, TP53-R273H induces drug resistance when procaspase-3 is down-regulated.	17363498	PubMed	NA	Wong et al., 2007, Mol. Cancer Ther.

Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

B-RAF activity was determined using kinase dead MEK as a substrate. A727V activity was 14 times higher than basal WT BRAF. The authors classified A727V activity as intermediate, since its kinase activity was between basal WT BRAF and G12V RAS-activated WT B-RAF cells. In comparison, some BRAF variants displayed high kinase activity above the G12V RAS-activated WT BRAF cells.	15035987	PubMed	NA	Wan et al., 2004, Cell	NA	2	accepted	7614	1198	5	7	140434515	140434515	G	A	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	GRCh37	NA	Unknown	2021-06-21 16:44:41 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7614	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1198	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5	FALSE	A728V

Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop.

All 10 cases that were positive for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant were either the spindle cell (3/12) or the sclerosing (7/9) subtypes of RMS, while all 10 cases of the embryonal subtype of RMS were negative for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant. The study suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is specific for spindle cell and sclerosing subtype of RMS (where it was detected in 10/21 cases or 48%). The study also confirmed the positive relationship between the spindle cell and the sclerosing subtypes of RMS, which both can have the same molecular abnormality (MYOD1 L122R variant) and are now considered to be the same subtype. Finally, the study confirmed the negative correlation between the aforementioned subtypes with the embryonal subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma.	27562493	PubMed	NA	Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod. Pathol.

None of the embryonal RMS cases was positive for the MYOD1 L122R variant. All cases were treated with surgical resection and either adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, or both. On patient follow-up, the alive-with-disease ratio was higher in the adult than in the pediatric population. Furthermore, the patients positive for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-positive states on follow-up, while the patients negative for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-free states on follow-up. This suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.34).	27562493	PubMed	NA	Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod.

There was one case of predominantly spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma with the MYOD-1 mutation that also contained a PIK3CA mutation. The case with both MYOD-1 and PIK3CA mutations consisted histologically of lipoblasts within focally myxoid stroma, thus demonstrating that the PIK3CA mutation was a secondary aberration while MYOD-1 was the primary neomorphic mutation. On clinical follow-up, seven of the MYOD-1 variant cases experienced local recurrences and/or metastatic disease. In a median of a 13.5 month follow-up, there was 1 patient who passed away, 8 patients who were alive with the disease, and 3 patients who were alive without the disease; there was no correlation with the type of treatment that the patients had received. This supports aggressive clinical course for SC/SRMS positive for MYOD-1 variants, regardless of the presence of a concurrent PIK3CA mutation.	30604891	PubMed	NA	Tsai et al., 2019, Histopathology	NA	3	accepted	8313	3032	3777	11	17741694	17741694	T	G	ENST00000250003.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2020-06-24 16:47:21 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8313	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3032	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3777	FALSE	L122R

There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88).

This study found that 107 of the 219 (49%) patients had this mutation signifying that the BRAF V600E mutation is one of the most commonly occurring among PTC patients. This cohort was split into two groups—BRAF+ and BRAF-. Of the 107 patients that were BRAF+, 25% had tumor reoccurrence compared with 9% in the BRAF- group (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess BRAF correlation independent of known contributing factors to cancer such as age, gender, and multifocality. The results showed that the BRAF mutation is indicative/contributes to lymph node metastasis, associated with tumor reoccurrence, stage, and that recurrent disease was more extensive and required more aggressive treatments in BRAF+ patients compared with BRAF- patients.

In vitro reconstitution of the PPP2A holoenzyme was also inhibited by PPP2R1A P179R. Crystal structures of the mutant and wildtype proteins revealed changes in PPP2R1A protein structural conformation that impacts the interaction with the PPP2CA C-subunit, and increases the binding energy between the PPP2R1A and PPP2CA subunits from 236 to 347 kJ/mol for wildtype and mutant protein, respectively. Cell lines that expressed PPP2R1A P179R had increased proteosome-mediated degradation of the PPP2CA (C-subunit), PPP2R2A (B55α) and PPP2R5A (B56α) subunits. Together, this evidence points to PPP2R1A P179R mediated disruption of the PPP2A complex.	31142515	PubMed	NA	Taylor et al., 2019, Cancer Res	NA	4	accepted	9212	3299	4463	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2021-03-29 20:51:24 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9212	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3299	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4463	FALSE	P179R

Immunofluorescence revealed that the P250L mutant cell line had reduced nuclear and increased cytoplasmic staining as compared to the wildtype. The punctate staining suggested that the P250L mutant forms large aggregates within the perinucleus. Chemical disruption of the microtubule assembly resulted in a shift from punctate to diffuse cytoplasmic staining in the P250L cell line. The oligomerization state of the wild type and P250L p53 was analyzed using Blue-Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) and western blot analysis: It was found that the wild type p53 appeared as monomers, tetramers and octamers while the P250L p53 formed large masses. More importantly, it was found that the formation of these aggregates by the P250L mutant could lead to co-aggregation of the wild-type p53, causing dominant negative activity. Additionally, the P250L mutant was found to inactivate the p53 paralogs, p63 and p73, while upregulating HSP70 and HSP90.	21445056	PubMed	NA	Xu et al., 2011, Nat Chem Biol	NA	5	accepted	9285	3318	45	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Unknown	2021-05-03 20:00:07 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9285	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3318	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/45	FALSE	P250L

Methyltransferase activity assays showed that the Y641 mutants were more effective than the wildtype in catalyzing dimethyl to trimethyl reactions. In comparison to the wildtype, the enzyme turnover and catalytic efficiency for the mutants was lower for the non methylated and monomethylated substrates, and higher for dimethylated substrates. Western blots of patient derived lymphoma cell lines (one homozygous wildtype and four heterozygous Y641 mutant lines) supported steady state enzyme kinetic predictions where the homozygous wildtype line demonstrated increased me1 and me2, but decreased 3me at H3K27. Alternatively, the heterozygous lines displayed increased 3me but decreased me1 and me2 at H3K27.

MYOD1 L122R variant was identified in 17 cases (3%) and was not restricted to spindle-cell histology, but was also observed in association with other histologic patterns (including cases with densely packed cells that mimicked embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) or RMS not otherwise specified ). MYOD1 mutation showed association with older age, head and neck primary site, and a dismal survival. In both COG and UK patient cohorts, patients with the MYOD1 L122R mutation had rapid disease progression and significantly worse event free survival as compared to the patients with wild-type MYOD1.	34166060	PubMed	NA	Shern et al., 2021, J Clin Oncol	NA	4	accepted	9532	3032	3777	11	17741694	17741694	T	G	ENST00000250003.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2021-07-18 03:31:22 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9532	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3032	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3777	FALSE	L122R

The G31A mutation did not lead to tumor formation in the pooled assay but did cause tumor formation in 6/6 mice in the individual experiment. The NFE2L2:p.G31A allele was also found to be expressed at significantly higher levels as compared to wild type. Short term gene expression correlation analysis was also completed using HA1E cells and the L1000 Luminex bead-based gene expression assay. Transcript level of 978 landmark genes were measured to formulate a gene expression signature for the allele. Overexpression of the mutant allele led to a similar signature as overexpression of the wild type, suggesting that the gain-of-function changes induced by the mutant can also be seen in NFE2L2-overexpressed cells.	27147599	PubMed	NA	Kim et al., 2016, Cancer Discov	NA	3	accepted	9574	3457	3878	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Unknown	2022-01-22 00:12:56 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9574	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3457	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3878	FALSE	G31A

The study analyzed 101 patients who had undergone surgical resection of confirmed primary extra-abdominal or abdominal wall aggressive fibromatosis. Specimens were reviewed for the presence of T41A, S45F, and 45P mutations on the CTNNB1 gene. Mutations were found in 76 patients, with T41A being most common (n = 49), followed by S45F (n = 18), and 45P (n = 3). The 5-year cumulative risk of recurrence was 22.8%. Further analysis revealed that patients with an S45F mutation had a 5-year recurrence risk of 63.8% and an 8.5-fold higher risk of recurrence compared to patients with wild type tumors (P=0.006).	25341748	PubMed	NA	van Broekhoven et al., 2015, Ann Surg Oncol	NA	4	accepted	9788	1286	1290	3	41266137	41266137	C	T	ENST00000349496.5	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2021-10-21 18:42:07 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9788	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1286	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1290	FALSE	S45F

3887	SF3B1	23451	K700E	Leukemia	1240	NA	Etoposide,Olaparib	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	The cancer-associated SF3B1-K700E mutation compromises homologous recombination repair and increases the sensitivity to ionising radiation and DNA damaging agents, such as etoposide or small molecule inhibitors including olaparib in isogenic K562 cell line. The SF3B1-WT and SF3B1-K700E cell lines were also engrafted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice, and the mice were treated with etoposide, olaparib or a vehicle control and monitored tumour growth for 28 days. Treatment with either etoposide or olaparib significantly reduced the volume of the SF3B1-K700E mutant tumours, but had little effect on the volume of SF3B1-WT tumours.	35027467	PubMed	NA	Lappin et al., 2022, Cancer Res	NA	3	accepted	10139	565	44	2	198266834	198266834	T	C	ENST00000335508.6	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2022-01-27 18:20:35 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/10139	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/565	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/44	FALSE	K700E
3891	IDH1	3417	R132C	Cancer	162	NA	Olaparib	NA	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	IDH1 R132C mutation confers a switch of function mutation where the mutated protein produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), rather than α-ketoglutarate (αKG). The novel metabolite induces a homologous recombination (HR) defect that sensitizes the tumor cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. PARP inhibitor sensititivity was tested in vivo in HeLa cells where the R132C mutation was create with CRISPR, the HCT116 colon cancer cell line where R132C mutation was created with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), and the HT1080 human sarcoma cell line which already has R132C. The results were then duplicated in non-commercial glioma cell lines: 6 IDH1 R132 mutant; 4 IDH1 wt.	28148839	PubMed	NA	Sulkowski et al., 2017, Sci Transl Med	NA	3	accepted	10144	59	26	2	209113113	209113113	G	A	ENST00000415913.1	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.
