3077	EGFR	1956	Rare Mutation	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910	NA	Gefitinib	NA	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A Japanese Phase III clinical study assessed the noninferiority of gefitinib as compared to erlotinib in 561 advanced stage (IIIB and IV) postoperative lung adenocarcinoma patients. All patients had prior chemotherapy but no treatment with TKIs. 19 patients had unspecified uncommon EGFR mutations, including single mutations other than ex19del and L858R and double mutations. Of those 19 patients, 7 were treated with erlotinib and 12 were treated with gefitinib. Objective response (42.9% for erlotinib and 25% for gefitinib) and disease control rate (71.4% with eflotinib and 66.7% with gefitinib) between were not significantly different between the treatments. The study failed to satisfy the primary endpoint of demonstrating statistical noninferiority in PFS of gefitinib.	27022112	PubMed	NA	Urata et al., 2016, J. Clin. Oncol.

Among 115 patients with mutational analysis at baseline, subsets were evaluated for complete hematologic response (CHR) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR). Both were comparable for patients with P-loop mutations versus patients without Abl1 mutations [ CHR = 9/9 vs. 27/27; MCyR = 7/10 vs. 19/35 (54%)]. The authors conclude that bosutanib is effective across all BCR-ABL mutations observed except T315I.	21865346	PubMed	NA	Cortes et al., 2011, Blood	NCT00261846	3	accepted	6336	2375	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2018-07-12 21:31:56 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6336	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2375	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4	FALSE	P-LOOP MUTATION

3684	ABL1	25	P-Loop Mutation	Chronic Myeloid Leukemia	8552	NA	Imatinib	NA	Predictive	Supports	C	Resistance	In this study, patients on imatinib monotherapy were monitored for ABL1 kinase domain variants in BCR-ABL1 fusions amplified from peripheral blood RNA. Of 14 patients who started the study in late chronic phase and had p-loop or non-p-loop mutations, 6/6 with p-loop mutations died compared to no deaths during the course of the study for those with non-p-loop mutations (P=0.0013). 14 patients who started the study in accelerated phase and had p-loop or non-p-loop mutations, 6/7 with p-loop mutations died and 3/6 with non-p-loop mutations died (P=0.14). Overall, this data suggests p-loop mutations that arise during late-chronic phase support resistance to imatinib.	12623848	PubMed	NA	Branford et al., 2003, Blood	NA	2	accepted	8094	2375	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2020-07-24 23:18:46 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8094	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2375	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4	FALSE	P-LOOP MUTATION
