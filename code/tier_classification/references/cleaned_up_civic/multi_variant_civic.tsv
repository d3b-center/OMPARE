The effect of panitumumab on PFS in the KRAS wt group was significantly greater than in the KRAS mutant group (HR:0.45, 95% CI:0.34-0.59 vs HR:0.99, 95% CI:0.73-1.36; P<0.0001). None of the 84 panitumumab-treated patients with KRAS mutant tumors responded to treatment (100% positive predictive value for nonresponse in mutant group). In the KRAS wt group treated with panitumumab (n=124), 21 patients had partial response (17%), 42 experienced stable disease (34%). Additionally, patients with KRAS mutations showed no significant improvement between treatment with panitumumab and BSC alone (PFS: 7.4 wk vs 7.3 wk). The authors concluded that their findings support the hypothesis that KRAS mutations confer primary resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies and recommend that KRAS status be evaluated prior to panitumumab administration.	18316791	PubMed	NA	Amado et al., 2008, J.

Note: while differences in PFS were nonsignificant between patients with wildtype or mutant KRAS, differences in objective response (defined as reduction by at least 30% in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions compared to baseline) were significantly different. Of the 32 patients with mutant KRAS, none responded to cetuximab-containing salvage therapy, while 14/60 of the patients with wildtype KRAS (23%) responded (p=.002).	19603024	PubMed	NA	Souglakos et al., 2009, Br.

In univariate analysis, KRAS mutations (G12V, G12S, G12D, G12A, G13V, G13D) were significantly associated with lack of response to panitumumab or cetuximab (objective response rate: 2/32 vs 20/77 for patients harboring KRAS mutated or wildtype tumors, respectively; P = 0.019). Multivariate logistic regression of KRAS mutations, PIK3CA mutations and PTEN protein expression also confirmed an independent effect of KRAS mutations on objective response (p = 0.0029).
