2113	BRAF	673	Non-V600	Colorectal Cancer	9256	NA	NA	NA	Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	This study of  9,643 patients characterized clinical implications of non-V600 BRAF mutations in metastatic CRC. Of the patients with metastatic CRC that underwent NGS testing, 208 patients had non-V600 BRAF mutations (22% of BRAF mutations identified and 2.2% of total patients tested ). When compared to V600 BRAF mutations, tumors without V600 BRAF mutations were more prevalent in younger patients (58 v 68 years, respectively) and male patients (65% vs 46%, respectively). Additionally, non-V600 BRAF mutations were less prevalent in high-grade tumors (13% v 64%, respectively) and right-sided primary tumors (36% v 81%, respectively). Median overall survival was significantly longer in patients with non-V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic CRC compared with those with both V600E BRAF-mutant and wild-type BRAF metastatic CRC (60.7 v 11.4 v 43.0 months).	28486044	PubMed	NA	Jones et al., 2017, J.

3597	BRAF	673	Non-V600	Solid Tumor	NA	NA	Trametinib	NA	Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Sensitivity/Response	In a phase II basket trial (NCI-MATCH), patients with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies harboring BRAF non-V600 mutations were treated with trametinib. Among 50 patients assigned, 32 were eligible and received therapy with trametinib. Most common tumor histopathologic subtypes were GI cancers (n=8, of which 7 were colorectal adenocarcinoma), lung adenocarcinoma (n=9), prostate adenocarcinoma (n=4), gynecologic cancer (n=4),  BRAF alterations included BRAF fusion (n=1), G464 (n=2), G466 (n=4), G469 (n=7), N581 (n=3), D594 (n=11), L597 (n=2) and K601 (n=1). Of the 32 patients evaluable for efficacy endpoints, the response rate was 3% (3/32). The patient with a partial response had invasive breast cancer with a BRAF G469E mutation. The median PFS was 1.8 months and the median OS was 5.7 months.	31924734	PubMed	NA	Johnson et al., 2020, Clin. Cancer Res.
