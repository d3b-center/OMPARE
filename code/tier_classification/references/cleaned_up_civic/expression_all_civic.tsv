FOXP3 expression was found in 405 tumor samples and associated with improved OS in patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy (6 cycles of 'FEC100' aka epirubicin + cyclophosphamide + 5-fluorouracil) but not in patients treated with sequential anthracycline->taxane (3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel). In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression). The authors observed that, while valproic acid has no intrinsic cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, it enhanced the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin specifically in cell lines where FOXP3 expression was increased.	22431701	PubMed	NA	Ladoire et al., 2012, Ann.

Methylome analysis revealed three CpG clusters (C1–3) with differential methylation to be negatively correlated with differential c-MET mRNA expression. In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (Δβ ≥ 10% and FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients. In two human BRAF V600E mutant cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to progressive methylation-expression changes akin to observations across MAPKi-sensitive versus resistant tumors.	26359985	PubMed	NA	Hugo et al., 2015, Cell	NA	4	accepted	1581	621	52	7	116312459	116436396	NA	NA	ENST00000318493.6	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	N/A	2016-08-18 11:15:43 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1581	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/621	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/52	FALSE	OVEREXPRESSION

Bafetinib (INNO-406) and dasatinib showed drastically higher IC50 values (970.3 nM and 91nM) in K562/D1-9 than the non-resistant K562 cell line (24.7 nM and 1.5nM), suggesting resistance in the presence of ABCB1 overexpression. The authors state that Bafetinib resistance is likely attributable to it being substrates of P-glycoprotein while nilotinib, which is unlikely to be a P-glycoprotein substrate, had a smaller change in IC50 between the two cell lines. Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell proliferation using the MTT assay.	18191450	PubMed	NA	Deguchi et al., 2008, Leuk. Res.

Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy.	17442989	PubMed	NA	Chinot et al., 2007, J.

Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways.

While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.

All tumors with unfavorable histology were p53 positive, in contrast to 13 of 33 tumors with favorable histology, with weak-moderate p53 signal (p<0.001). 2 year overall survival rate was 89.2% in p53 negative, and 55.7% for p53 positive cases (P = .01), and mean survival was 46 months in p53 negative and 26 months in p53 positive cases (P = .02). Compared with p53 negative, tumors with week to moderate p53 signal had HR 3.75 (P = .05), and high signal had HR 8.61 (P = .01). No significant correlation was seen between tumor clinicopathological stage and p53 expression.	21525573	PubMed	NA	Jadali et al., 2011, Iran J Kidney Dis	NA	3	accepted	8945	1306	45	17	7571720	7590856	NA	NA	ENST00000269305.4	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	N/A	2020-12-10 02:04:51 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8945	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1306	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/45	FALSE	OVEREXPRESSION

3886	IGF1R	3480	Overexpression	Breast Cancer	1612	NA	Metformin,Exemestane	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	A randomized phase III trial of hormone sensitive (ER or PR positive) early stage breast cancer (Dutch TEAM cohort, n=2,446) examined the addition of metformin to exemestane for 155 patients. IGF1R IHC was performed and patients classified as IGF1R high (n=105) or low (n=50). In IGF1R-high patients, combining metformin with exemestane was associated with significant RFS (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57–2.23 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.73 95% CI 0.56–0.94 for exemestane only, and HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10–1.00 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.02, compared to the sequential treatment arm). There was also significant association with OS (HR for OS 1.72, 95% CI 0.96–3.08 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.03 for exemestane only, and HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31–1.45 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.03, compared to the sequential treatment arm).
