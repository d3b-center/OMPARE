1975	TP53	7157	ALTERATION	Ovarian Cancer	2394	NA	Cisplatin,Carboplatin	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	In a group of patients with invasive ovarian carcinoma who had undergone surgery, a subset of 74 patients treated with platinum based chemotherapy were assessed for  p53 alteration (p53 mutation or p53 overexpression by immunostaining >10% positive). Significant decreased time to progression (p=0.037) was seen in the subset of  patients with p53 alteration (n=54) in comparison to the group with normatl p53 (n=20)	11595686	PubMed	NA	Reles et al., 2001, Clin.

2098	TP53	7157	ALTERATION	Ovarian Cancer	2394	NA	NA	NA	Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	In a study of invasive ovarian carcinoma patients who had undergone surgery, the p53 alteration variant was defined as p53 mutation or p53 overexpression by immunostain (>10% positive). Patients with p53 alterations showed increase in poor tumor cell differentiation (p<0.001) and increase in tumor cellular S-phase fraction (p<0.001). Out of 178 patients, p53 alteration (n=132) was associated with decreased overall survival in comparison to normal p53 (n=46), p=0.007.	11595686	PubMed	NA	Reles et al., 2001, Clin. Cancer Res.

3859	TP53	7157	ALTERATION	Rhabdomyosarcoma	3247	Young adult onset,Pediatric onset	NA	NA	Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study evaluated 641 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that were enrolled in the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group (COG) trials from 1998 to 2017 and the UK malignant mesenchymal tumor and RMS2005 trails from 1995 to 2016. Molecular testing included 39 genes which had been implicated in the past with regards to RMS. The analysis was performed with a custom-capture sequencing assay. Altered TP53 was noted in 69 out of 515 FOXO1 fusion-negative RMS cases (13%), with the most frequent mutations at codons G245S (6 cases), R248Q or W (6 cases), R175H (4 cases), and P72A (4 cases). These cases displayed a worse event free survival. In FOXO1 fusion-positive RMS subtype, there was a small number of cases with altered TP53 (3 and 2 cases in the COG and UK patient cohorts, respectively), but they were universally fatal. Due to lack of a matched germline sample, it could not be determined whether the TP53 abnormalities were of somatic or germline origin. Nevertheless, both cohorts show that mutations in TP53 are associated with a poor prognosis in both fusion-negative and fusion-positive RMS, with a particularly bleak outcome in fusion-positive RMS.	34166060	PubMed	NA	Shern et al., 2021, J Clin Oncol	NA	4	accepted	9594	1307	45	17	7571720	7590856	NA	NA	ENST00000269305.4	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	P53 ALTERATION is a bucket type variant used in studies which is constructed by combining all cases of p53 mutation together with p53 overexpression.
