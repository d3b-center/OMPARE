Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.

Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib.

The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response. Authors further note that luminal type cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal type cell lines (p=0.02).	20453058	PubMed	NA	O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin. Cancer Res.

Authors found that while PTEN loss induced resistance to trastuzumab, combination with dactolisib produced an additive anti-proliferation effect.	19010894	PubMed	NA	Eichhorn et al., 2008, Cancer Res.

In HER2 patients with decreased or absent PTEN expression, T-DM1 was a more effective treatment than standard of care capecitabine + lapatinib as measured by PFS, although no difference in OS was seen.	26920887	PubMed	NA	Baselga et al., 2016, Clin.

In the 20 cases of AT/RT, expression of INI1 was not detected in tumor cells using the BAF47/SNF5 monoclonal INI1 antibody. Expression of INI1 was detected in 31 out of the 33 remaining tumors, with one Oligodendroglioma showing no expression, and one pituitary adenoma showing weak expression. The authors conclude that immunohistochemical staining with an INI1 antibody may be useful in confirming histologic diagnosis of AT/RT.	15105654	PubMed	NA	Judkins et al., 2004, Am. J. Surg. Pathol.
