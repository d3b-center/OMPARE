With dasatinib monotherapy, imatinib-resistant patients with and without ABL1 mutation  had comparable complete hematologic response [CHR= 90% (345/384) vs. 93% (390/421)], major cytogenetic response [MCyR= 56% (211/384) vs. 58% (243/421)], complete cytogenetic response [CCyR= 43% (164/384) vs. 47% (196/421)], and major molecular response [MMR= 31% (115/367) vs. 36% (145/404)]. Of the 63 imatinib-resistant variants observed (see comment), the authors associate T315I, F317L, and V299L with resistance to dasatinib or lower levels of response due to clinical resistance and low in vitro sensitivity.
