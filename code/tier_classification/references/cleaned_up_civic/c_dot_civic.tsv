1382	JAK2	3717	c.1641+1dup	Skin Melanoma	8923	NA	Pembrolizumab	NA	Predictive	Supports	C	Resistance	Paired tumor samples were analyzed from four patients with metastatic melanoma and initial response with a subsequent relapse under pembrolizumab (PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) therapy. Baseline biopsies were obtained before therapy initiation with pembrolizumab. A JAK2 F547 splice site mutation was observed at the time of relapse in patient 2. RNA sequencing revealed an in-frame stop codon after exon 12. The JAK2 mutation was the only homozygous mutation (allele frequency >85%) of 76 new nonsynonymous mutations in patient 2. Cell line modelling of baseline and relapse JAK2 mutational status revealed a loss of response to interferon gamma and  loss of JAK2 protein. This loss of response was also modeled in another cell line.	27433843	PubMed	NA	Zaretsky et al., 2016, N. Engl. J. Med.

VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.

VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

A 2cm x 1.8cm x 1.5cm lesion close to costovertebral angle of third right thoracic vertebra was found via PET scan were histological findings found this to be consistent with paraganglioma. Blood samples for genomic DNA analysis were taken and screening for mutations in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, RET, SDHAF2, TMEM127, MAX, NF1, FH, MDH2, and EPAS1 genes was negative but she was positive for a heterozygous mutation in the VHL gene, c.311G > T (p.Gly104Val). This same variant was found in her 17 year-old sister and her mother but not in her father. Her mother refused a complete staging. The probands sister presented with a small retinal hemangioblastoma at this time. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM2' since this variant is absent from controls (gnomAD), 'PP1' since there is cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members, 'PP2' since we have a missense variant in a gene where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease, 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.	29789510	PubMed	NA	Bahougne et al., 2018, J Clin Med	NA	3	accepted	7134	2428	58	3	10183842	10183842	G	T	ENST00000256474.2	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Rare Germline	2022-01-12 17:35:46 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7134	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2428	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/58	FALSE	G104V (C.311G>T)

Homozygosity mapping revealed their parents (who also had cancer) had a consanguineous union. Each sibling was homozygous for CHEK2 R474C. The brother also had a son who died of neuroblastoma at 22 months of age. Amino acid R474 is highly conserved (98%) and forms a salt bridge in both the inactive and active CHEK2 homodimer. Modeling reveals R474C likely negatively affects the saltbridge and destabilizes the protein.

The presence of other phenotypes was not described. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and mutations were detected using direct sequencing of the 3 exons of VHL and/or southern blot analysis. A germline missense mutation (c.256C>T) was found in 3 patients, 2 of which were related. Patient No 7 from family 503 presented with pancreatic endocrine tumour, pheochromocytoma, and renal carcinoma and patient No 15 from family 503 presented with pancreatic endocrine tumour. Their familial relation was not described. Patient No. 27 from family 11 also had the same mutation and presented with pancreatic endocrine tumour, pheochromocytoma, and renal carcinoma. The patients' phenotypes are highly specific to VHL disease (ACMG PP4).	18580449	PubMed	NA	Corcos et al., 2008, Pancreas	NA	3	accepted	8771	1902	58	3	10183787	10183787	C	T	ENST00000256474.2	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Rare Germline	2022-01-12 17:35:47 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8771	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1902	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/58	FALSE	P86S (C.256C>T)

Fifty-four Black patients presenting with phaeochromocytoma between 1980 and 2009 were included. Two patients had VHL syndrome (submitted for publication). The second diagnosis of VHL syndrome was made in the pregnant woman (Case 9) who had bilateral adrenal phaeochromocytomas. There were no clinical features of VHL syndrome; however, MRI showed a haemangioblastoma in the cervical spine. Genetic testing revealed a missense mutation (c.499C>T) in the VHL gene, located on chromosome 3p26-p25. Her 6-year-old daughter screened positive for the mutation; her 8-year-old son was negative. Both mother and daughter will be investigated further and monitored long-term.

PCR-SSCP or Southern blot analyses of the DNA from family members showed that mutations were segregated with disease phenotype in VHL families, although this data was not shown. Data on the presence of retinal angioma, CNS hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and pheochromocytoma was available. Case 46 had p.Leu117Pro (c.353T>C) mutation. 1 member was affected with RCC (ACMG PP4).
