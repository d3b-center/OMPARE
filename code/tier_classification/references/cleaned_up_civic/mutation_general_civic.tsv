Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations.	23934108	PubMed	NA	Hatzivassiliou et al., 2013, Nature	NA	3	accepted	1140	336	30	12	25362365	25403737	NA	NA	ENST00000256078.4	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2016-06-22 19:00:05 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1140	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/336	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30	FALSE	MUTATION

Western blots of UD-SCC-3 cells with increasing taselisib concentration showed reduction of phospho-Akt only at micro-molar doses, in contrast to nano-molar range for sensitized cells. Slight induction of the apoptotic marker cleaved PARP was only apparent at 4 micro-molar dose. Similar results were reported with the PTEN mutant HNSCC cell line UPCI-SCC-90, and 4 of the 6 most taselisib resistant cell lines had PTEN mutation.	26589432	PubMed	NA	Zumsteg et al., 2016, Clin.

These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC.

However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment.

Six GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations, three of which were deemed imatinib-sensitive by the authors: 1 DIMH842-845 deletion, one I843 deletion, and one V561D point mutation. Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients).

Patients received cabozantinib 100 mg/d during a 12-week lead-in. Patients with stable disease (SD; RECIST) at week 12 were randomized to cabozantinib or placebo. During lead-in phase, 55% of evaluable patients showed reduction in target lesion size (59% uveal melanoma). Uveal melanoma cohort included 23 patients, 9 with GNAQ (n=5) and GNA11 (n=4) mutations. Responses were reported in mutational patients. In the uveal melanoma cohort, 61% of patients (14/23) had SD at week 12, and no patient had a PR, resulting in an overall disease control rate of 61%. The median PFS for the 23 patients with uveal melanoma was 4.8 months.	28103611	PubMed	NA	Daud et al., 2017, Br. J.

Patients with KRAS wildtype, PIK3CA assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=339) were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Patients harboring PIK3CA mutant tumors (n=34) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype PIK3CA (6/34 [17.7%] vs 115/305 [37.7%]; p =.015). Patients with mutant PIK3CA also experienced lower disease control rate in response to cetuximab treatment. However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype PIK3CA in progression free or overall survival (median PFS: 18 vs 24 weeks; median OS: 39 vs 51 weeks).

Authors concluded that this result contributes to a theoretical basis for including PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other molecularly targeted drugs in the treatment of patients with KRAS mutations.	28259530	PubMed	NA	Li et al., 2017, Eur J Surg Oncol	NA	2	accepted	4864	336	30	12	25362365	25403737	NA	NA	ENST00000256078.4	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2020-09-10 23:47:22 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/4864	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/336	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30	FALSE	MUTATION

Of those patients, 12 received six courses of chemotherapy composed of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin (or epirubicin), and cyclophosphamide. This treatment group represented patients with the following mutations (number of patients in parentheses): E545K (7), E542K (1), and H1047R (4). The other 11 patients received 12 weekly courses of paclitaxel followed by four courses of the chemotherapy described above.

Salvage chemotherapy was composed of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) only, 5-FU + oxaliplatin, 5-FU + irinotecan, or 5-FU + oxaliplatin + irinotecan. The study assessed the relationship between BRAF mutation status in primary tumors and response to cetuximab-containing salvage chemotherapy, as measured by PFS.

3188	PIK3CA	5290	Mutation	Colorectal Cancer	9256	NA	Aspirin	NA	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803)  and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.	23094721	PubMed	NA	Liao et al., 2012, N. Engl. J. Med.

3756	IDH2	3418	Mutation	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119	NA	Venetoclax	NA	Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	In this case series, 7 elderly patients with secondary AML (sAML) not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and refractory to HMA (including 1 patient with antecedent myeloproliferative neoplasm) were treated with venetoclax monotherapy. Three of 7 patients showed response. Of these: 2 patients achieved complete remission (1 of which was mutated for IDH2). One patient with IDH1 mutation showed PB blast clearance (derived anti-leukemic benefit) but BM was not performed to evaluate response. Venetoclax responders had high BCL‐2 and/or BIM expression levels in myeloblasts, and the response was significantly associated with OS. BCL-2 and BIM expression levels can potentially identifer venetoclax responders.	30725494	PubMed	NA	Huemer et al., 2019, Eur. J. Haematol.

3759	ATRX	546	Mutation	Malignant Astrocytoma	3069	Brain neoplasm,Glioma	NA	NA	Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Whole exome sequencing of 4 low grade gliomas (LGGs) and targeted sequencing of 28 LGGs revealed ATRX variants are found exclusively in a subset of IDH1-mutant, 1p/19q intact LGGs. Paired blood samples were sequenced in all cases and mutations were confirmed by Sanger. IDH1mutation was found in 28/32 LGGs and of these 12 possessed an ATRX mutation (~43%). In all 12 ATRX mutated cases 1p/19q was intact (correlation p=0.0003), and ATRX variants were not observed in the 12 1p/19q codeleted cases. Additionally, multiplex mRNA profiling of 28 astrocytic tumors with subclasses assigned based on 75 gene signatures demonstrated ATRX mutations were associated (p=.0044) with the early progenitor-like subclass (EPL) (11/13 EPL cases harbored ATRX mutants).	23104868	PubMed	NA	Kannan et al., 2012, Oncotarget	NA	3	accepted	8868	3203	525	X	76760356	77041702	NA	NA	ENST00000373344.5	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2020-09-24 02:29:34 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8868	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3203	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/525	FALSE	MUTATION

3877	ACVR1	90	MUTATION	Diffuse Midline Glioma, H3 K27M-mutant	0080684	NA	NA	NA	Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	It has been reported that recurrent activating somatic mutations (R206H, R258G, G328E/V/W, G356D) in the ACVR1 gene, which encodes a type I activin receptor serine/threonine kinase, are in 21% (11/52) of DIPG samples. The mutations were highly specific to DIPG, with an overall frequency of 0.3% in other tumors present in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database. Data was collected from whole genome sequencing on 20 pre-treated biopsy samples of DIPG as well as whole exome sequencing from 1 biopsy sample and five samples obtained at autopsy. An additional 26 DIPG biopsy samples were screened via Sanger sequencing and identified the variant (G328W). DIPG cases with somatic mutations of ACVR1 (R206H, R258G, G328E/V/W, G356D) had longer overall survival (n=11 versus 41; median of 14.9 versus 10.9 months; p=0.05, log-rank test).	24705252	PubMed	NA	Taylor et al., 2014, Nat.
