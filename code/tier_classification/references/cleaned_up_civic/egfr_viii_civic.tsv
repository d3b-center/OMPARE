Anti-tumor effects of nimotuzumab were greater in EGFRvIII in comparison to EGFRwt (as measured by antitumor effects, growth suppression, survival elongation and EGFR and Akt phosphorylation). Combination of nimotuzumab and temozolomide further increased efficacy.	26778701	PubMed	NA	Nitta et al., 2016, Cancer Med	NA	1	accepted	1017	312	19	7	55087058	55223523	NA	NA	ENST00000275493.2	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	The EGFRvIII variant is an oncogenic mutation that has been reported in several cancers including glioblastoma multiforme, breast, lung, head and neck, ovarian and prostate.
