80	BRAF	V600E and Amplification	COLO201 and COLO206F cells harboring BRAF V600E mutations were cloned to be MEK inhibitor (AZD6244 [selumetinib]) resistant. The mechanism of this resistance was shown to be amplification of the BRAF V600E gene. BRAF V600E amplification was observed in 1/11 colorectal cancer patient samples evaluated, indicating this subclone (28% of cells) would be MEK inhibitor resistant.
376	ALK	EML4::ALK and Amplification	Amplification of wild-type EML4-ALK in the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line, H3122, caused resistance to crizotinib.
607	ALK	EML4::ALK and Amplification	This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One out of 11 patients with acquired crizotinib resistance showed >4-fold increase in rearranged ALK copy number between pre- and post- crizotinib biopsies as measured by FISH. This patient's tumor did not harbor ALK point mutations, and was wt for KRAS and EGFR. This patient was a 51 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, whose best response was partial response (454 days on crizotinib, 2 prior lines of therapy). The authors suggest that ALK copy number gain alone may induce crizotinib resistance.
608	ALK	EML4::ALK and Amplification	One patient with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer and an acquired resistance to crizotinib showed new ALK amplification (4.1 fold increase compared to pre-crizotinib specimen as measured by FISH) and harbored an EGFR L858R mutation.
924	MET	EXON 14 MUTATION and AMPLIFICATION	64-year old female (non-smoker) was diagnosed with NSCLC. A c.3028 G->A mutation was identified in exon 14 resulting in exon 14 skipping. Further, amplification of the MET gene was observed. The patient was given crizotinib and CT scans showed a positive response after 8 weeks of treatment.
3133	BRAF	V600E/K and Amplification	In a retrospective study of 44 relapsed melanoma patients harboring BRAF V600E or V600K (known BRAF inhibitor sensitizing mutations), MAPK pathway reactivation mechanisms were implicated in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) monotherapy. The following MAPK pathway variants were found in progressive tumors with patient matched baseline tumors (some patients donated samples from multiple geographically/temporally distinct progressive tumors): NRAS mutations (G12D, G12R, G13R, Q61K, Q61R, Q61L) in 13/71 (18%) of progressive tumors, KRAS mutations (G12C, G12R, Q61H) in 5/71 (7%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF amplification (2-15 fold or 4-75 copies) in 11/57 (19%) of progressive tumors, mutant BRAF alternative splice variants (novel exon boundaries between 1/9, 1/11, 3/9) in 6/48 (13%) of progressive tumor RNA.
