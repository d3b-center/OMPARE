NPM-ALK G1269A was also tested for brigatinib sensitivity, and IC50 values of 11 nM were reported for both NPM-ALK G1269A and NPM-ALK wild-type. In western blotting, brigatinib at and above 100 nM ablated pALK signal (Y 1604), indicating sensitivity of this variant to brigatinib together with the other results.	25727400	PubMed	NA	Fontana et al., 2015, Cancer Med	NA	2	accepted	1353	552	1	2	29432682	29432682	C	G	ENST00000389048.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2016-07-10 21:38:02 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1353	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/552	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1	FALSE	ALK FUSION G1269A
1173	ALK	238	ALK Fusion G1269A	Cancer	162	NA	Alectinib	NA	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	EML4-ALK with ALK G1269A mutation was tested for sensitivity to alectinib using Ba/F3 cells. In Ba/F3 cells with ectopic EML4-ALK variant 1 G1269A, IC50 of 84 nM was reported with alectinib, which was a 6 fold increase over IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type. The authors considered a fold difference of 4 to 10 between the alectinib-sensitized wild-type and mutant variant to indicate a resistant mutant variant. In the background of the NPM-ALK fusion, IC50 for G1269A mutation was 104 nM, which was 5.3 fold that reported for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of alectinib treated NPM-ALK G1269A were performed and reduced pALK Y1604 was seen at 300 nM alectinib, and no pALK at 1000 nM. In contrast pALK signal was ablated at and above 100 nM in NPM-ALK wild-type.	25727400	PubMed	NA	Fontana et al., 2015, Cancer Med	NA	3	accepted	1354	552	1	2	29432682	29432682	C	G	ENST00000389048.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2016-07-10 21:40:43 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1354	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/552	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1	FALSE	ALK FUSION G1269A
1174	ALK	238	ALK Fusion G1269A	Cancer	162	NA	Ceritinib	NA	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	EML4-ALK with G1269A mutation was tested for sensitivity to ceritinib via transduction into Ba/F3 cells and generation of survival curves varying ceritinib concentration. IC50 of 33 nM was seen, which was 1.5 times the IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type, indicating sensitivity of the G1269A mutation to ceritinib in the context of EML4-ALK. The mutation was also tested for ceritinib sensitivity in the context of NPM-ALK, where IC50 values were reported of 19 nM and 20 nM for mutant and wild-type versions, respectively, also indicating sensitivity. In western blots,  Y1604 pALK levels for wild-type NPM-ALK were ablated at 100 nM, while at 100 nM residual pALK levels were seen in G1269A blotting, with ablation of signal at and above 300 nM, which differed somewhat from the equivalent IC50 values reported for mutant and wild-type in the NPM-ALK background, but still agrees with sensitivity to ceritinib for this mutation.	25727400	PubMed	NA	Fontana et al., 2015, Cancer Med	NA	2	accepted	1355	552	1	2	29432682	29432682	C	G	ENST00000389048.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2016-11-04 22:14:21 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1355	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/552	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1	FALSE	ALK FUSION G1269A

Biopsy was taken within half a month and total DNA was extracted from the sample. Exons 20-28, which correspond to the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK, were sequenced, and ALK G1202A was found. CKIT focal amplification by FISH was also observed. Tumor sample before crizotinib treatment was not available in this case.	22277784	PubMed	NA	Katayama et al., 2012, Sci Transl Med	NA	3	accepted	1357	171	1	2	29443613	29443613	C	T	ENST00000389048.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	ALK fusion with G1202R mutation in the ALK kinase domain was first identified in a lung adenocarcinoma patient who had progressed after 10 months of responding to crizotinib. Further characterization of this variant verified crizotinib resistance and additionally demonstrated resistance to multiple next generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib. Experiments using the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG have indicated potential sensitivity of EML4-ALK G1202R to this drug, suggesting this variant may be an HSP90 client protein.

ALK rearrangement was verified via FISH. She was treated with crizotinib at 250 mg twice daily but discontinued due to adverse response. She then started alectinib at 600 mg twice daily with partial response, but new liver metastases then formed at 5 months. Liver tumor biopsy was performed and was estimated to be 15% tumor tissue. Next-generation sequencing discovered an ALK I1171N mutation. The tumor was not sequenced prior to alectinib resistance.	25736571	PubMed	NA	Ou et al., 2015, Lung Cancer	NA	2	accepted	1367	527	1	2	29445213	29445213	A	G	ENST00000389048.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	Multiple case reports indicate that the I1171T missense mutation in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) confers resistance to crizotinib and alectinib but is sensitive to ceritinib treatment.

In vitro evidence indicates this mutation interferes with alectinib binding the active site of ALK and may explain the sensitivity to the structurally distinct ALK inhibitor ceritinib.

Liver tumor biopsy was taken and estimated to be 15% tumor. Hybrid capture next generation sequencing was performed and an I1171N mutation was found in rearranged ALK, and estimated to be in 33% of the tumor cells. Ceritinib was given at 750 mg once daily but dose reduction to 600 mg once daily was required due to persistent nausea.
