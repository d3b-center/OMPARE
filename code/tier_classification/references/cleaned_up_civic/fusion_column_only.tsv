Ultimately concluding that more than one method is needed to accurately diagnose patients due to the strengths and weaknesses of each individual method.

Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	17625570	PubMed	NA	Soda et al., 2007, Nature	NA	5	accepted	1188	5	1	2	42396490	42522656	NA	NA	ENST00000318522.5	2	29415640	29446394	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37	The EML4-ALK fusion variant 1 consisting of ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) fused to EML4 exons 1-13 is the most common EML4-ALK variant, and was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer.

Although these numbers are not sufficient for statistical comparison, they compare unfavorably to 3.1 year overall survival and 45% 5 year survival of CHOP treated DLBCL patients, and even less favorably to R-CHOP standard of care for CD20 positive DLBCL, suggesting poor prognosis for CLTC-ALK DLBCL and need for updated treatment in this cohort.	19636007	PubMed	NA	Laurent et al., 2009, J.

Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course.	26221234	PubMed	NA	Li et al., 2015, Int J Clin Exp Med	NA	3	accepted	1265	520	1	17	57697219	57768072	NA	NA	ENST00000269122.3	2	29415640	29446394	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37	The t(2;17)(p23;q23) translocation results in the CLTC-ALK fusion protein, the most common ALK fusion observed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

The majority of patients (70.1%) had received two or more prior antineoplastic therapies. An overall response rate of 25.4% was observed and an additional 38.8% of patients had disease stabilization. No clear differences between type of FGFR3 aberration and response could be seen. Four of five patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions had response data, with three achieving stable disease and one having a complete response. The authors conclude that BGJ398 appears to have moderate anticancer activity in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, that response rates and disease control rate exceed outcomes with most agents in this setting, and that enriching for patients with activating FGFR3 mutations together with the high specificity of BGJ398 for FGFR3 likely explains this improved response.	29848605	PubMed	NA	Pal et al., 2018, Cancer Discov	NA	3	accepted	6409	830	23	4	1795039	1808661	NA	NA	ENST00000340107.4	4	1741429	1746898	ENST00000313288.4	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2021-05-05 05:52:18 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6409	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/830	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/23	FALSE	FGFR3::TACC3

Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib.

RNA studies demonstrated a Ph-like ALL expression signature but did not identify the underlying kinase fusion. Research level RNA sequencing identified a GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion which was confirmed by other methods and patient cells were introduced to patient-derived xenograft models that demonstrated a response to ruxolitinib. Therefore, 40mg/m2 ruxolitinib was added to the patient’s multiagent chemotherapy regiment. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient demonstrated significant clinical response by the end of consolidation, though MRD ≥ 0.01% was detected by flow cytometry. The patient received CART therapy and achieved MRD negative remission, then underwent HSCT, and remained in remission with full donor chimerism at 2-months post-HSCT.	29773603	PubMed	NA	Ding et al., 2018, Haematologica	NA	3	accepted	7007	3214	28	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the GOLGA5 (Golgin A5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 10 of GOLGA5 to exon 12 of JAK2 (GOLGA5-JAK2 10-12). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14)(p24;q32), and has been identified in one patient by RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from GOLGA5 and an aberrantly activated JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, which is thought to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The novel GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 10-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with complex karyotype. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. A xenograft model created from the patient's malignant cells demonstrated clearance of the leukemic clone in murine peripheral blood upon exposure to ruxolitinib. Moreover, this drug was added to the child's treatment regimen, resulting in nearly undetectable levels of the GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion measured after 64 days of therapy. The patient has reportedly remained in remission 20 months after CAR T-cell infusion and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This child was included in the currently ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in treating pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease.

Using a series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lorlatinib was the most effective inhibitor of cytokine-independent growth. The glioblastoma cell line U118MG was shown to have the GOPC–ROS1 fusion. Lorlatinib and other TKIs were unable to inhibit growth of U118MG in standard growth assays (2D). However, lorlatinib did induce cell death in both ultra-low attachment dishes and spheroid assays, and significantly increased overall survival in an orthotopic intracranial xenograft model using this cell line (N=4) compared to mice on vehicle alone (N=4, p<0.001, ANOVA).

The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion was confirmed by PCR and targeted ligation amplification, and was found to fuse exon 27 of FOXP1 to exon 4 of ABL1. The case was shown previously to have BCR-ABL1-like signature by hierarchical clustering of gene expression data (PMID: 23974192). The patient was treated with the ALL9-high risk protocol, did not respond to therapy, and passed away.	27894077	PubMed	NA	Boer et al., 2017, Oncotarget	NA	1	accepted	7651	2682	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the FOXP1 (Forkhead box P1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 27 of FOXP1to exon 4 of ABL1 (FOXP1-ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;9)(p12;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS. FOXP1 is critical for the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis; it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. Absence or deficiency of FOXP1 during early B-cell development may block pro-B cell to pre-B cell development. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion protein leads to activated tyrosine kinase and may further alter the critical cellular function of these 2 genes. Clinical significance: The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in 3 young adult patients (2 male, 1 female) with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One patient had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib) added to the chemotherapy regimens, who had bone marrow tested negative for MRD at end of consolidation.

The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 4 of ETV6 to exon 17 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 4-17), exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 12 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-12), or exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 19 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-19). The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;12)(p24;p13), cytogenetically cryptic, and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the PNT domain from ETV6 and JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. The ETV6 PNT domain is hypothesized to result in dimerization, which leads to aberrant JAK2 kinase domain activation. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functional effects and disease specificity of the abnormal fusion. Functionally, the fusion results in aberrant activation of JAK2 kinase, leading to activation of downstream signaling through the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (~10%), T-lymphoblastic leukemia (isolated cases), and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and gene rearrangements (rare cases). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been associated with high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been shown by limited pre-clinical data and case reports to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors.

This case supports sensitivity of B-ALL with RCSD1-ABL1 fusions to ABL-type tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	27125982	PubMed	NA	Perwein et al., 2016, Haematologica	NA	3	accepted	7783	2681	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RCSD1 (RCS Domain Containing 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 2 or, more frequently, exon 3 of RCSD1 to exon 4 of ABL1 (RCSD1-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(q24.2;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the ABL1 SH2, actin binding domain, and tyrosine kinase domain, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in greater than fifteen pediatric and adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. The majority that that were exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs: imatinib, dasatinib, or ponatinib) experienced durable remissions until the TKIs were discontinued. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with TKIs and are the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

FISH and nested PCR revealed the patient had a t(4;22)(q12;11) translocation that created an in-frame BCR-PDGFRA fusion. The constitutively activating coiled-coil domain and serine/threonine kinase encoded by BCR exon 1 fused with exon 13 of PDGFRA, which retained both tyrosine kinase domains. During initial therapy, intensification, and consolidation, hyperleukocytosis persisted. Based on the presence of the BCR-PDGFRA fusion, single agent imatinib (Glivec) was administered. A complete hematological response was observed within 6 weeks as the presence of t(4;22) in the bone marrow went from a 70% down to 15%. However, the patient had a relapse in the central nervous system. Continued treatment with imatinib along with intrathecal chemotherapy achieved a meningeal remission after 2 weeks. According to the authors, this patient’s response implicates PDGFRA as a clinically actionable imatinib target.	12944919	PubMed	NA	Trempat et al., 2003, Oncogene	NA	3	accepted	7990	2971	38	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2020-04-21 17:18:23 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7990	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2971	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/38	FALSE	BCR::PDGFRA

Post resection, multiple nodular metastases were found in both lungs and the disease progressed following treatments with cytotoxic agents and microwave ablation. Overexpression of PDGFRB was detected by IHC and a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by RT-PCR. Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways. Imatinib treatment failed as stable disease was followed by disease spread and progression. The patient was then treated with a daily oral dose of sunitinib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. After 2 months on sunitinib, the patient experienced overall shrinkage of the body’s tumor mass (reduction of tumor in arm and partial response in lung and pancreas metastases). Sunitinib resulted in 9 months of progression free survival and improved quality of life. Ultimately, the disease progressed and the patient died 46 months after diagnosis.	29760553	PubMed	NA	Xiao et al., 2018, Onco Targets Ther	NA	3	accepted	7991	2972	4173	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2020-05-11 23:23:58 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7991	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2972	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4173	FALSE	COL1A1::PDGFB

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 10 of ATF7IP to exon 8 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 10-8), exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 16 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-16), or exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 17 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;12) (p24;p13.1), and has been identified by RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing in three adult patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil and MDN1 domains from ATF7IP and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2.

A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.	29804288	PubMed	NA	López et al., 2019, Neuropathol.

A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days.

The total of 44 new and previously published ETV6-ABL1 positive cases were detected and characterized using conventional cytogenetics, FISH, RT-PCR, SNP/copy number arrays, expression arrays and a custom Taqman 'low-density array' (LDA card). Among the 44 cases, there were 22 cases of B-ALL (13 children, 9 adults), and 22 myeloid malignancies (18 myeloproliferative neoplasms, and 4 acute myeloid leukemias). The 9 ETV6-ABL1 positive ALL cases (7 diagnosis and 2 relapse samples) that underwent whole genome expression profiling displayed similar expression profiles to the BCR-ABL1 positive leukemia cohort. Also, 9/10 ETV6-ABL1 BCP-ALL cases were classified by custom Taqman assay (designed to detect BCR-ABL1-like expression signature) as BCR-ABL1-like. The study thus shows that in B-ALL, the presence of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion correlates with the BCR-ABL1 like (Ph-like) subtype of the disease.	27229714	PubMed	NA	Zaliova et al., 2016, Haematologica	NA	4	accepted	9073	2575	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2021-05-17 21:29:41 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9073	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2575	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4	FALSE	ETV6::ABL1

Two cases were positive for the NUP214-ABL1 fusion, identified by RNA-seq analysis. In both cases the fusion was generated by a small copy number gain (duplication) in 9q34, with the breakpoints in the two partner genes. Considering the previously shown Ph-like expression signature in the studied cases, the results suggest association of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion in B-ALL with the Ph-like genetic subtype of the disease.	22897847	PubMed	NA	Roberts et al., 2012, Cancer Cell	NA	2	accepted	9074	2660	4	9	134000948	134106156	NA	NA	ENST00000359428.5	9	133730188	133763062	ENST00000318560.5	75	GRCh37	The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease.

3813	ABL1	25	SFPQ::ABL1	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Young adult onset	NA	NA	Oncogenic	N/A	C	N/A	The authors describe two cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with the t(1;9)(p34;q34) rearrangement, resulting in a fusion between the pre-mRNA processing protein gene SFPQ and the ABL1 kinase gene. Patient 1 was a 19-year old female patient with common B-cell ALL expressing 2 myeloid markers. Due to the presence of the 2 myeloid markers, she was treated with a classic acutemyeloid leukemia (AML) induction regimen (cytarabine and idarubicin), along with imatinib due to the involvement of the ABL1 locus. Patient achieved complete remission, followed by a consolidation regimen with cytarabine and mitoxantrone, a non-familial allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a dose-reduced conditioning, and a maintenance treatment with dasatinib. Complete remission was maintained 32 months after the allograft. Patient 2 was a 28 year old female, diagnosed with common B-ALL (EGIL B-II), and was included in the GRAALL 2005 protocol with intensified cyclophosphamide administration, and was corticosensitive but chemoresistant (60% blasts at day 8). She achieved complete remission after the induction regimen, and this was followed by consolidation regimen with cytarabine, high-dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. After this, familial allograft with her brother as donor was performed, and she remained in complete remission 18 months after allograft. FISH and sequencing have confirmed the fusion between SFPQ-ex9 and ABL-ex4 in both patients. The authors conclude that the t(1;9)(p34;q34), fusing SFPQ in 1p34 with ABL1 in 9q34, represents a recurrent abnormality in B-ALL.	21388681	PubMed	NA	Duhoux et al., 2011, Leuk Res	NA	3	accepted	9158	3287	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SFPQ (Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of SFPQ to exon 4 of ABL1 (SFPQ -ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(p34;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The role of the partner gene SFPQ in this fusion remains to be investigated. SFPQ encodes for a protein belonging to a new functionally related group of fusion partners for tyrosine kinases involved in pre-mRNA processing. The presence of 2 coiled-coil domains in the 9 remaining exons of SFPQ could theoretically lead to SFPQ–ABL1 oligomerization, thus leading to constitutive activation of the resulting tyrosine kinase, as reported with other partner genes. Though uncommon, this translocation might be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical significance: The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion has been documented in six patients (3 male, 3 female) between the ages of 10 and 34 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, who did not have relapse. One additional patient who did not have tyrosine kinase inhibitor also did not suffer from relapse. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.

Three (6%) of the adult but none of the childhood B-other cases were positive for ABL-class aberrations. One of these adult patients was a 29-year old male with a t(1;9)(p34;q34). RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed that the translocation resulted in a rare SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated with allogenic stem-cell transplant with addition of dasatinib and imatinib, and was in remission at the time of publication (28 months after the diagnosis). A review of 6 previously published cases with SFPQ-ABL1 fusion indicated that exon 9 of SFPQ and exon 4 of ABL1 were consistently involved. The fusion was typically found in adolescents/younger adults without hyperleukocytosis, and IKZF1 deletions were recurrently found. In the cases reported, patients who were not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation had relapsed, and the authors therefore suggest that TKIs should be added to the therapy of SFPQ-ABL1-positive B-ALL.	32306475	PubMed	NA	Biloglav et al., 2020, Genes Chromosomes Cancer	NA	3	accepted	9159	3287	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SFPQ (Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).

The RCSD1-ABL1 t(1;9)(q22;q34) fusion between exon 3 of RCSD1 and exon 4 of ABL1 was identified by RT-PCR. The patient was enrolled on GMALL elderly (01/2003) and treated accordingly with an induction failure. She therefore continued chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase. Her disease achieved first complete remission in January 2013, and high-dose cytarabine was administered. The patient experienced a BM relapse in April 2013. Re-induction chemotherapy with one cycle of FLAG-Ida comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, GCSF and idarubicin was administered, but BM revealed residual disease with 70% of leukemic blasts in May 2013. The patient was included in the BEZ235 study and treated with an oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, but no remission could be achieved. Salvage therapy with single agent dasatinib was initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily, in July 2013. A stable disease with partial remission in the BM was achieved. Moreover, inhibition of RCSD1-ABL1 activity by dasatinib was shown by Western analysis of phosphorylated ABL1 and its downstream target CRKL. Treatment with dasatinib was complemented with two cycles of chemotherapy, including clofarabine and cyclophosphamide. CR 2 was achieved in October 2013, whereas minimal residual disease (MRD) levels still remained positive. In this regard, treatment with blinatumomab was started within the MT103-203 study in January 2014, and MRD levels became negative. In March 2014, allo-SCT was performed successfully. Since then, there is an ongoing remission that, to date, has lasted 30 months.	28057740	PubMed	NA	Frech et al., 2017, Haematologica	NA	3	accepted	9168	2681	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RCSD1 (RCS Domain Containing 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).

The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with TKIs and are the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).

Specifically, one 34-year-old man with MEF2D-CSF1R identified by RNAseq was prescribed an unspecified dose of imatinib as adjuvant to his frontline chemotherapy (protocol GRAALL-2014). His initial MRD analysis at 94 days remained positive for blasts (1 x 10^-4), but was consistent with continuous complete remission at day 147.	31434701	PubMed	NA	Tanasi et al., 2019, Blood	NA	3	accepted	9360	30	33	1	156446804	156470620	NA	NA	ENST00000348159.4	5	149433787	149441412	ENST00000286301.3	75	GRCh37	MEF2D-CSF1R is a fusion that has been observed in acute lymphocytic leukemia.

RT-PCR or RNAseq performed on Ph-like, CRLF2 negative patients revealed one case of the novel TBL1XR1-CSF1R fusion. No clinical information pertaining to this individual was disclosed. Considering the previously confirmed Ph-like expression signature in the tested cases, the results suggest that the presence of the TBL1XR1-CSF1R fusion in B-ALL may indicate the BCR-ABL1-like (Ph-like) subtype of the disease.	28408464	PubMed	NA	Reshmi et al., 2017, Blood	NA	3	accepted	9361	3359	33	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The TBL1XR1-CSF1R fusion is composed of part of the TBL1XR1 (Transducin Beta Like 1 X-Linked Receptor 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). CSF1R is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The breakpoint is not published, but is predicted to be the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;5)(q26.32;q32) and has been identified by RNA sequencing in a single pediatric patient. The consequence of this fusion with respect to treatment response and disease outcome is unknown.

3843	ABL1	25	SFPQ::ABL1	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630	Juvenile onset,Young adult onset	NA	NA	Oncogenic	N/A	C	N/A	219 newly diagnosed NCI high-risk, Ph-negative, B-ALL patients between ages 1 to 18 were enrolled on DFCI ALL Consortium protocol 05-001 (NCT00400946) between 2005 and 2011. This study sought to determine the frequency of kinase-activating fusions in this patient cohort. Testing of 105 patients by validated multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays identified one male patient (age>10) with the SFPQ-ABL1 fusion. This patient was also positive for the IKZF1 gene deletion. Although no other information is available for the patient with the SFPQ-ABL1 fusion, in univariate analysis, fusion-positivity and IKZF1 deletion were each associated with inferior event-free survival and IKZF1 deletion also retained statistical significance in multivariable analysis.	29507076	PubMed	NA	Tran et al., 2018, Blood Adv	NA	2	accepted	9362	3287	4	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SFPQ (Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of SFPQ to exon 4 of ABL1 (SFPQ -ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(p34;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The role of the partner gene SFPQ in this fusion remains to be investigated. SFPQ encodes for a protein belonging to a new functionally related group of fusion partners for tyrosine kinases involved in pre-mRNA processing. The presence of 2 coiled-coil domains in the 9 remaining exons of SFPQ could theoretically lead to SFPQ–ABL1 oligomerization, thus leading to constitutive activation of the resulting tyrosine kinase, as reported with other partner genes. Though uncommon, this translocation might be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical significance: The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion has been documented in six patients (3 male, 3 female) between the ages of 10 and 34 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, who did not have relapse. One additional patient who did not have tyrosine kinase inhibitor also did not suffer from relapse. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.

In the pediatric cohort (n = 293; age, 0-18 years), NUP98/NSD1 was present in 16.1% of the cases. The authors identified the cytogenetically cryptic NUP98/NSD1 translocation as an independent factor for dismal clinical outcome for both pediatric and adult patients. The remission rate (CR) of NUP98/NSD1-positive cases in the pediatric cohort was 100%, but 10 of the 12 cases relapsed early. The cumulative incidence of nonresponse/relapse (pCIR) at 4 years was 83 ± 13% for NUP98/NSD1-positive versus 45 ± 3% for negative cases (P < .001). NUP98/NSD1 cases had a poor event-free survival (pEFS) and overall survival (pOS) (4-years pEFS, 8 ± 8% vs 46 ± 3%, P < .001; and 4-years pOS, 31 ± 16% vs 64 ± 3%, P = .011 for NUP98/NSD1-positive vs negative cases, respectively).	21813447	PubMed	NA	Hollink et al., 2011, Blood	NA	4	accepted	9720	2593	3995	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2021-09-24 05:23:16 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9720	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2593	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3995	FALSE	NUP98::NSD1
3862	PDGFB	5155	COL1A1::PDGFB	Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans	3507	NA	NA	NA	Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study analyzed 27 formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded samples of patients with known dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) using a newly designed multiplex RT-PCR assay. The assay identified COL1A1-PDGFB fusion transcripts in all but one DFSP case, which was consistent with concurrent FISH testing on the same samples. The study concluded that COL1A1-PDGFB rearrangements appear more prevalent in DFSP (96%) than previously reported. The use of sensitive molecular assays for detection of COL1A1-PDGFB fusion may improve diagnosis in cases of atypical, variant, or metastatic DFSP.	17950782	PubMed	NA	Patel et al., 2008, Hum Pathol	NA	4	accepted	9787	2972	4173	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Somatic	2021-10-21 18:38:03 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/9787	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2972	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4173	FALSE	COL1A1::PDGFB
