PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors, 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 10 mutation was not significantly associated with differences in colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.15 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed	NA	Liao et al., 2012, Clin. Cancer Res.

E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that exon 10 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for variants in PIK3CA are still in early clinical trial phases.

Of patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs, 71 (83.5%) had a partial response, 7 had stable disease, 4 had progressive disease and 3 were nonassessable.  Patients with KIT exon 11 mutations were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with KIT exon 9 mutations (P=.0006)  or double WT kinases (WT KIT and WT PDGFRA; P < .0001). The presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was the strongest predictor of response (Hazard ratio= 7.85). Patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced longer event free survival (median: 687 days) than those with  KIT exon 9 mutant or double WT kinase GISTs (200 days and 82 days, respectively). Furthermore, patients whose tumors expressed an exon 11 mutant KIT had improved overall survival compared to patients whose tumor expressed an exon 9 mutant KIT (P = .0034)  or double WT kinases (P <.0001).	14645423	PubMed	NA	Heinrich et al., 2003, J.

FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurence with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.

3563	CTNNB1	1499	Exon 3 Mutation	Desmoid Tumor	0080366	NA	NA	NA	Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	N/A	This study illustrates the prevalence of CTNNB1 mutations in sporadic desmoid tumors, and examines whether the presence of CTNNB1 mutations correlates with the disease outcome. CTNNB1 mutations (including specific exon 3 mutations T41A, S45F, S45P, and S45C) were found in 106 out of 145 desmoid tumor specimens, and in 86 out of 115 specimens from patients who had undergone complete surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the 5-year recurrence free survival rate of patients with the beta-catenin mutated tumors was worse than that of the patients with wild-type tumors (58% vs 74%), however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.285). Thus, the study shows that there is no statistically significant correlation between the CTNNB1 mutation and the recurrence risk of sporadic desmoid tumors, even though specific exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations are commonly identified in these tumors.	23960186	PubMed	NA	Mullen et al., 2013, Oncologist	NA	4	accepted	7784	2892	1290	3	41266017	41266244	NA	NA	ENST00000349496.5	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2020-11-25 00:14:18 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7784	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2892	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1290	FALSE	EXON 3 MUTATION

CTNNB1 mutations were detected in all six cases with extensive (>50% of the tumor cells) nuclear staining of beta-catenin. Remarkably, five out of these six tumors demonstrated a loss of chromosome 6, a cytogenetic event that is absent in CTNNB1-wildtype tumors (p <0.0001, Fisher’s exact test).	19197950	PubMed	NA	Fattet et al., 2009, J.

Cases displaying evidence of Wnt/Wg activation (CTNNB1 mutation and/or beta-catenin nuclear stabilization) were exclusively associated with a distinct genomic signature involving loss of an entire copy of chromosome 6 but few other aberrations. Loss of chromosome 6 was exclusively observed in Wnt/Wg-activated medulloblastoma, as evidenced by 3 of 3 cases with nuclear immune-positivity for b-catenin in the first cohort (19 cases). In the second cohort (32 cases), loss of chromosome 6 is observed in Wnt/Wg-active tumors and absence in Wnt/Wg-negative cases (8/13 vs. 0/19; p=0.0001).	17172831	PubMed	NA	Clifford et al., 2006, Cell Cycle	NA	4	accepted	7967	2892	1290	3	41266017	41266244	NA	NA	ENST00000349496.5	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2021-01-26 02:20:38 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7967	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2892	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1290	FALSE	EXON 3 MUTATION
