These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169  to trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.	26822398	PubMed	NA	Harbeck et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.

Patients were HER2-positive by IHC3+ or FISH, and patients who had received prior hormonal treatment or adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy with or without trastuzumab for longer than 12 months before randomization were also eligible.  The two arms of the study were trastuzumab and docetaxel with either placebo or pertuzumab.  Median PFS in the placebo arm was 12.4 months while in the petuzumab arm 18.5 months was achieved.  Median OS in the control arm was 40.8 months and 56.5 months with pertuzumab.  These strong results make a case for dual antibody blockade in first line treatments of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.	25693012	PubMed	NA	Swain et al., 2015, N. Engl. J. Med.

Earlier deaths were seen with heavier HER2 expression.  Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients.  The authors conclude that high HER2 expression in USPC is associated with poor outcome and explains observed differences in outcome between ethnicities.	15746676	PubMed	NA	Santin et al., 2005, Am. J.

HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.  The investigators conclude there is promise in trastuzumab-based therapies in advanced endometrial cancers, including USPC.	18555254	PubMed	NA	Santin et al., 2008, Int J Gynaecol Obstet	NA	4	accepted	1097	306	20	17	37856333	37884915	NA	NA	ENST00000269571.5	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered.

During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.  The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study.

Patients were required to have progressed on or after treatments involving trastuzumab and a taxane, and no prior exposure to lapatinib or T-DM1.   Primary endpoints included independently assessed progression free survival (PFS) and safety. PFS was 9.6 months in T-DM1 group vs. 6.4 months in lapatinib plus capecitabine.  Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher were greater with lapatinib plus capecitabine.  These results, together with other trials such as TH3RESA indicate promise for T-DM1 therapy in HER2 amplification, and this will be further studied in an arm of the NCI-MATCH trial.	23020162	PubMed	NA	Verma et al., 2012, N.

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft. Ponatinib treatment inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma cell lines.	26179511	PubMed	NA	Agelopoulos et al., 2015, Clin. Cancer Res.

Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.
