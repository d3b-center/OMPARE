Objective response (defined as complete + partial response) was approximately 65 percent for both erlotinib gefitinib and non significantly different  (p= .965). Disease control rate (defined as complete response + partial response + stable disease) was 91.6 and 83.3 percent for erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively (p=.113). The study was unable to demonstrate statistical noninferiority via the planned end point; however, the lack of statistically significant differences between erlotinib and gefitinib responses, and the milder adverse effects experienced by gefitinib treated patients, led the authors to conclude that gefitinib is a feasible alternative to erlotinib in treating patients with ex19del EGFR positive, advanced lung adenocarcinoma.	27022112	PubMed	NA	Urata et al., 2016, J.

These deletions, in non-small cell lung cancer, have been shown to be sensitive to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib. There is also data to suggest that this event is a good prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma. Examples of exon 19 deletions include: p.746_A750delELREA, p.747_753delinsS, p.747_752delLREATS, and p.747_751delLREAT.

The three cell lines were infected with lentivirus for either EGFR or de4 EGFR, and lentivirus-infected cells were used to perform transwell migration assays, invasion assays, and cisplatin sensitivity assays.	23764753	PubMed	NA	Zhang et al., 2013, Carcinogenesis	NA	4	accepted	662	252	19	7	55214299	55214433	NA	NA	ENST00000275493.2	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2016-02-17 19:50:05 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/662	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/252	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/19	FALSE

Brigatinib treatment of CLB-BAR cells reduced MYCN protein levels and ALK phosphorylation (Y1604) similar to crizotnib. Brigatinib reduced CLB-BAR cellular proliferation more effectively than crizotinib (IC50 75.2 vs 186.4nM). CLB-BAR xenografts in BalbC/NUDE mice responded to brigatinib with reduced tumor volume and weight (N=8/group) as well as reduced ALK phosphorylation and MYCN levels compared to untreated controls. Release of brigatinib administration at day 15 resulted in tumor growth (N=2).	27049722	PubMed	NA	Siaw et al., 2016, Oncotarget	NA	3	accepted	1336	550	1	2	29474528	29853656	NA	NA	ENST00000389048.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2016-07-17 21:41:23 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1336	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/550	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1	FALSE

A biopsy was taken for whole genome and transcriptome analysis and the patient was started on systemic therapy. After showing resistance to the systemic therapy treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin was initiated based on the discovery of a somatic exon 11-19 in frame deletion in DPYD, which was hypothesized to increase sensitivity to 5-FU in the tumour. A dramatic clinical and radiographic response was sustained for 17 weeks, but following a 3 week treatment break a new nodule appeared. This recurrence showed resistance to re-initiation of treatment with capecitabine (oral 5-FU), and analysis of an additional biopsy provided no evidence as to the mechanism of resistance.	31871216	PubMed	NA	Majounie et al., 2019, Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud	NA	4	accepted	7787	2893	1526	1	97700408	98039526	NA	NA	ENST00000370192.3	NA	NA	NA	NA	75	GRCh37	NA	Somatic	2020-01-03 17:30:23 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7787	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2893	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1526	FALSE
